Looks like adafruit.io has a way to get groups informtion but it shows your private key. Possibly something we can do with this

send 
https://io.adafruit.com/api/groups/:group_name/send.json?x-aio-key=a0a0a00a0a0a0a0a00a0a0a0a00a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a

receive    
https://io.adafruit.com/api/groups/weather/receive.json?x-aio-key=a0a0a00a0a0a0a0a00a0a0a0a00a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a
