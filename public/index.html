</h3>


<h3 Align=center>Why Adafruit?</h3>
<ul>
<li> Great MQTT, Connects well with Helium, uses CayenneLPP for easy JSON data compression. Works well with Arduino Products.
<li> Has HTTP(s) access to online variables (I will check if you can download data using HTTPS)
<li> Awesome Developers, when asked if they could activate MQTT-Websockets they had it working in one day?
<li> MQTT-Websockets working
<li> Has a free tier with a sensible amount of data etc. 
</ul> 
  
<ol>  
<li>Signup/Login to the <a href="https://accounts.adafruit.com/users/sign_up/">Adafruit.io</a> website 
  
<li> First Send/Receive data from a static MQTT-Websocket  <a href="ada-websocket02.html"> ada-websocket02.html </a> WORKS GREAT
<li> Send data from an Arduino using HTTP (Working on this)  
<li> Send data from an Arduino using MQTT over HTTP  (Working on this)
<li> Send data from a webpage over  HTTP 
  <ol> 
  
   <li><a href="ada-write-to-feed00.html">ada-write-to-feed00.html</a> Send data to Adafruit from an HTML form. minor issues
   <li><a href="ada-write-to-feed01.html">ada-write-to-feed01.html</a> Send raw data to Adafruit using async await fetch. WORKS GREAT
   <li><a href="ada-write-to-feed02.html">ada-write-to-feed02.html</a> Send formatted <b>value=4</b> data to Adafruit using async await fetch. WORKS GREAT
   <li><a href="ada-write-to-feed03.html">ada-write-to-feed03.html</a> Send JSON formatted <b>{"value":"4"}</b> data to Adafruit using async await fetch. NOT YET WORKING! CORS issues
  
  </ol>
    
<li> Read data from a webpage over  HTTP   Draft: <a href="ada-read-feed02.html">ada-read-feed02.html</a>  WORKS GREAT 
    
  <li>Try an Adafruit integration with the <a href="https://console.helium.com/">Helium console</a> (advanced: need a LoRaWan board) Get 10,000 Data Credits for signing up. WORKS GREAT
</ol>

<h2 Align=center>Second place is:   <a href="https://hiveMQ.com/">HiveMQ</a></h2>
For giving up to 100 free devices and supporting Websocket-MQTT and for the potential connections with small devices



<h2 Align=center>Third place is:   <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/cloud/iot-cloud">Arduino Cloud</a></h2>
For making things easy

<H3> The Old Index, before Adafruit won!</h3>


And here are links to the very important static webpages that can communicate with a few IOT cloud platforms<br>
<b>Webhooks are important for small WiFi capable devices to send data, receive an update would be a nice bonus<br>
  
<a href="ubidots05.html">ubidots05.html</a>   or <a href="ubidots06.html">ubidots06.html</a>   or <a href="adafruit01.html">adafruit01.html</a>      or <a href="ada02.html">ada02.html</a>  
  Webhook static webpage using http or  https that works with Ubidots and can send-only to Adafruit and probably many other integrations.
  Note: I think Ubidots may have tightened up some security because I can't seem to get it working again!<br><br>
 
 Websockets are important to be able to display data live on a webpage also a bonus if they can send data<br> 
<a href="hive05.html">hive05.html</a>  This SSL websocket static webpage can communicate with both mosquitto and HiveMQ and probably many more<br><br>
  
  
 <h3  align=center > Note: For HiveMQ more data needs to be entered: username, password, clientID<br>

Why are static webpages important! NodeJS, PHP etc web servers are very powerful but confusing for my students. 
<a href="https://gitpod.io/">Gitpod</a> is amazing for development of complex web servers and it ties well with Github but does not stay active 
for very long, <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku Cloud</a> is also amazing and works well with Github but is also fairly complex for High School students. <br><br>

Many IOT cloud sites brag about their "Dashboard" and how easy it is to setup<br>
I like and dislike "dashboards" they are great to get things started, but eventually 
I will start to need the page view to be slightly different. Over the last 46 years of coding this situation has happened repeatedly where company programmers try to 
make things easier but actually just cripple your ability to do what you want.<br><br>

An example would be a machine learning program that works from your browser and updates an MQTT site every minute with summarized data. 
I could easily (might take a year LOL) make that however with Dashboards I would need my machine learning program on one webpage and the dashboard 
openned on another webpage. For many people that would be fine, for me that would be very frustrating.<br><br>

<h3>IOT cloud sites that are good but not yet great in my opinion!</h3>

<br><a href="">Arduino Cloud:</a> <br><font color="green">Great, easy to use, dashboard simple to understand</font><br> and has<font color="red"> NONE of my criteria in the image above! No free integrations, 
I have found no examples of easy to use MQTT, HTTPS, Websocket-MQTT. Even things like LoRaWan integrations with the 
  Portenta LoRa Vision Shield do not seem as easy to setup as they should be. </font>I love Arduino hardware and software, but the Arduino cloud is not yet ready 
for everything I need, other than<font color="green"> a quick student introduction to setting up a cloud variable and changing it.</font>




<br><br><a href="https://io.adafruit.com/">Adafruit:</a> <br><font color="green"> Free to use, great, easy to use MQTT connectivity also supports CayenneLPP simplification
of the JSON data, Dashboard easy to work with, works great with the <a href="https://explorer.helium.com/coverage">Helium</a> LoRaWan network and 
  the <a href="https://console.helium.com/">Helium Console</a>. Https webhooks works to update data</font>. <br> <font color="red">https Webhooks do not work to read data. Have not found websocket-MQTT</font>

<br><br><a href="https://tago.io/">TagioIO</a> or <a href="https://ubidots.com/">Ubidots</a> or <a href="https://thingspeak.com/">ThingSpeak:</a><br><font color="green"> Free to use. Great HTTPS connectivity, 
  my above webpage demonstrates Ubidots connectivity with https webhooks using a static webpage. </font><br><font color="red">I have not found websockets-MQTT and have not tested 
    arduino MQTT </font>

<br><br><a href="https://www.hivemq.com/">HiveMQ:</a><br><font color="green"> Free to use: Great WebSocket connectivity as seen by my static webpage above. 
  Fast easy to use and easy to understand. Lots of free use. </font><br><font color="red">Issues connecting websockets with Helium. I have not found out how to do https webhooks I have not yet tested MQTT with Arduino</font>


<br><br><a href="https://www.scaleway.com/en/iot-hub/">Scaleway iot-hub:</a> Was recommended to me but needs a Credit card
<br><br><a href="https://www.qubitro.com/">Qubitro:</a> Still testing, some positives some negatives

<br><br><a href="https://thingsboard.io/">Thingsboard:</a> Powerful, not sure if the cloud side is free.

<h3>A few things I have done</h3>
  
Youtube video going through each of the IOT platforms I have found not really finding much <br>

EdgeImpulse forum talking about the IOT cloud issue <a href="https://forum.edgeimpulse.com/t/arduino-mqtt-broker/2091/17">here</a>  <br><br>
  




The base github for this static webpage has a  README.md file with lots of Cloud IOT site links for twitter and webpages <a href="https://github.com/hpssjellis/my-examples-of-iot-platforms">here</a> <br><br>
  
The old research <a href="index-old.html"> index-old.html</a> page is here with lots of not working examples<br><br>
