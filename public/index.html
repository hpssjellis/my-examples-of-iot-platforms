And here are links to the very important static webpages that can communicate with a few IOT cloud platforms<br>
<b>
<a href="ubidots05.html">ubidots05.html</a> Webhook static webpage using https that works with Ubidots and probably many other integrations<br><br>
<a href="hive05.html">hive05.html</a>  This SSL websocket static webpage can communicate with both mosquitto and HiveMQ and probably many more<br><br>
<b>
  
  
Why are static webpages important! NodeJS, PHP etc web servers are very powerful but confusing for my students. 
<a href="https://gitpod.io/">Gitpod</a> is amazing for development of complex web servers and it ties well with Github but does not stay active 
for very long, <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku Cloud</a> is also amazing and works well with Github but is also fairly complex for High School students. <br><br>

Many IOT cloud sites brag about their "Dashboard" and how easy it is to setup<br>
I like and dislike "dashboards" they are great to get things started, but eventually 
I will start to need the page view to be slightly different. Over the last 46 years of coding this situation has happened repeatedly where company programmers try to 
make things easier but actually just cripple your ability to do what you want.<br><br>

An example would be a machine learning program that works from your browser and updates an MQTT site every minute with summarized data. 
I could easily (might take a year LOL) make that however with Dashboards I would need my machine learning program on one webpage and the dashboard 
openned on another webpage. For many people that would be fine, for me that would be very frustrating.<br><br>

<h3>IOT cloud sites that are good but not yet great in my opinion!</h3>

<br><a href="">Arduino Cloud:</a> Great, easy to use and has NONE of my criteria in the image above! No free integrations, 
I have found no examples of easy to use MQTT, HTTPS, Websocket-MQTT. Even things like LoRaWan integrations with the 
Portenta LoRa Vision Shield do not seem as easy to setup as they should be. Love Arduino hardware and software, but the Arduino cloud is not yet ready 
for everything I need other than a quick student introduction to setting up a cloud variable and changing it.




<br><br><a href="https://io.adafruit.com/">Adafruit:</a> Free to use, great, easy to use MQTT connectivity also supports CayenneLPP simplification
of the JSON data, Dashboard easy to work with, works great with the <a href="https://explorer.helium.com/coverage">Helium</a> LoRaWan network and the <a href="https://console.helium.com/">Helium Console</a>.

<br><br><a href="https://ubidots.com/">Ubidots</a> or <a href="https://thingspeak.com/">ThingSpeak:</a> Free to use. Great HTTPS connectivity, my above webpage demonstrates Ubidots 
connectivity with https webhooks using a static webpage.

<br><br><a href="https://www.hivemq.com/">HiveMQ:</a>Free to use: Great WebSocket connectivity as seen by my static webpage above. Fast easy to use and easy to understand. 
Lots of free use.

<h3>A few things I have done</h3>
  
Youtube video going through each of the IOT platforms I have found not really finding much <br>

EdgeImpulse forum talking about the IOT cloud issue <a href="https://forum.edgeimpulse.com/t/arduino-mqtt-broker/2091/17">here</a>  <br><br>
  




The base github for this static webpage has a  README.md file with lots of Cloud IOT site links for twitter and webpages <a href="https://github.com/hpssjellis/my-examples-of-iot-platforms">here</a> <br><br>
  
The old research <a href="index-old.html"> index-old.html</a> page is here with lots of not working examples<br><br>
